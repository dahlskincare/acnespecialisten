## Creating a new page
- Create a PHP file *my-folder/my-new-page*.php
- Create a CSS file *my-folder/my-new-page*.css
- Copy the contents of *template.php* into the new file
- Complete all the TODOs listed in the file (set language, title and meta, etc)
- Put your html content between the \<main> tags only
- Put your style content inside the new css file only
- Custom javascript is added manually
- Use lighthouse (built in to chrome devtools) to analyze the new page before deploying

## Localization
- Localized content should have the **l10n** class, for example; **\<p class="l10n">Hasta la vista\</p>**
